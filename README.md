# Pixel-Palz-Arcade

- The purpose of this project was to improve on my previous games and host them all in one place
- This project consists of a variety of mini games implementing JavaScript
- Each mini game includes characters and assets designed by me

<br> <strong>The Website: </strong> <br>

- I have been wanting to compile all my mini games in one place so I decided the best way to go about that would be to host them on a singular website since these games were made with JavaScript
- I wanted the home page to be fun and easy to access so I thought it would be best to add icon PNGs of what made each game unique
- For each individual mini game web page I didn't want there to he a distracting menu linking to the other games, so with the help of CSS and JavaScript I added a hamburger style dropdown menu in which you can access each individual game
- Each web page has a unique background and border
- I intend to make every mini game compatible on mobile devices hopefully with the help of @media query in CSS
